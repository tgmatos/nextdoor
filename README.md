NextDoor is an e-commerce platform project writtin in Elixir and TypeScript.

# Backend
The backend is writtin in Elixir using the [phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).

The reason for choosing Elixir and Phoenix was the easy development and rich ecosystem. With Elixir's OTP it is simple to scale this application by just adding new nodes.

# Frontend
The frontend is written in TypeScript with Vue 3. The reason for choosing this front-end stack was my familiarity with it.
